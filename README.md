# Ski-Area-Analysis

This is an ongoing project in which I have been putting together data from every ski resort in the US in order to analyze them on some different metrics. I also plan on looking at the effect of corporate ownership (Vail/Alterra) on ticket prices, as these corporations have been receiving increased backlash recently as they buy up more ski resorts.

For each resort, I have used web scraping to obtain the following data:

  - Day ticket price
  - Elevation/vertical drop
  - Total length of slopes
  - Skiable acreage
  - Number of lifts, including each type (gondola, quad, high-speed, etc.)
  - State
  - Annual snowfall
  - Owner

The final compiled dataset is in ski_data.csv

Future ideas:

  - Include season pass prices, including Epic/Ikon passes. See how quickly season pass pays off vs day ticket
